# UnityFirstProject

This is my first project for Unity, and first time setting up a repository for soley my own project!

## Features/Development
Game is based upon Unit 4 in the Junior Programming Pathway from Unity Learn.
However, a lot was expanding upon, including:
* Extensive amount of novel enemy balls created, each with a targeting, movement, and/or mechanic unique to it
* New powerups designed to give user more abilities
* Spawn Manager is given certain number of "points" that increases each round
  * Each enemy is given a specific spawn "point value" dependent on its strength
  * * These points are smartly delegated to generate the optimal enemy balls each round
